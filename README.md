## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager
- (Optional) CUDA-compatible GPU for faster training

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fbreseghello/Image-Based-Cancer-Diagnosis.git
   cd Image-Based-Cancer-Diagnosis
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (recommended)
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   
   # On Windows
   venv\Scripts\activate
   
   # On macOS/Linux
   source venv/bin/activate

4. **Prepare your dataset**
   
   Organize your histopathology images in the following structure:
   ```
   sample_images/
   ├── benign/
   │   ├── image1.jpg
   │   ├── image2.jpg
   │   └── ...
   └── malignant/
       ├── image1.jpg
       ├── image2.jpg
       └── ...
   ```

## 💻 Usage

### Training the Model

**Basic training:**
```bash
python train_model.py
```

**Advanced options:**
```bash
python train_model.py --epochs 50 --learning-rate 0.0001 --model-name my_model.h5
```

**Using transfer learning:**
```bash
python train_model.py --transfer-learning --epochs 30
```

**Available arguments:**
- `--epochs`: Number of training epochs (default: 30)
- `--learning-rate`: Initial learning rate (default: 0.001)
- `--model-name`: Name for the saved model file (default: cnn_model.h5)
- `--transfer-learning`: Use MobileNetV2 for transfer learning

### Evaluating the Model

```bash
python evaluate_model.py --model-name cnn_model.h5
```

This generates:
- Confusion matrix
- ROC curve
- Precision-Recall curve
- Classification report
- Prediction distribution analysis

All results are saved in `models/evaluation/`

## 📊 Model Architecture

### Custom CNN (Default)

- **Input Layer**: 224×224×3 RGB images
- **Data Augmentation**: Random flips, rotations, zoom, and shifts
- **3 Convolutional Blocks**:
  - Conv2D (32, 64, 128 filters) → BatchNorm → MaxPooling → Dropout
- **Dense Layers**: 256 → 128 → 1 (sigmoid)
- **Regularization**: L2 regularization + Dropout (0.5)
- **Total Parameters**: ~1.5M (varies by architecture)

### Transfer Learning (Optional)

- **Base Model**: MobileNetV2 (pre-trained on ImageNet)
- **Custom Head**: GlobalAvgPool → Dense(128) → Dropout → Dense(1)
- **Training Strategy**: Feature extraction with frozen base

## 📈 Performance Metrics

The model is evaluated using multiple metrics:

- **Accuracy**: Overall correctness of predictions
- **Precision**: Proportion of positive predictions that are correct
- **Recall (Sensitivity)**: Proportion of actual positives identified correctly
- **F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall
- **AUC-ROC**: Area under the ROC curve
- **Average Precision**: Area under the Precision-Recall curve

*Note: Actual performance depends on your dataset quality and size.*

## 🔬 Understanding Grad-CAM

Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping) highlights which regions of the image the model focused on when making its prediction. This helps:

- Validate that the model is looking at relevant tissue features
- Build trust in model predictions
- Identify potential biases or artifacts
- Assist pathologists in understanding AI decisions
